# Threadline

A React/Vinext application with a Cloudflare Workers backend and D1 storage.

## Local setup

Use Node 22.13 or later and the pnpm version pinned in `package.json`.

1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
2. Configure server credentials locally in `.dev.vars`. The server reads `QLOO_API_KEY` and, for the optional model connection, `MODEL_BASE_URL`, `MODEL_NAME`, `MODEL_API_KEY` and `MODEL_REASONING_EFFORT`. The model adapter uses a chat-completions endpoint with JSON output. Never prefix secrets with a browser-exposed environment prefix.
3. Run `pnpm build` to produce the local Worker configuration.
4. Apply the SQL files in `drizzle/` to the local `DB` binding, in order. Use Wrangler with `--local --config dist/server/wrangler.json --persist-to .wrangler/state`.
5. Start with `pnpm dev -- --port 5180` and open the printed local URL.

The development server supports a local preview identity. Production requires authenticated Sites access; do not expose the Worker directly without an equivalent trusted authentication boundary. Case reads and writes are scoped to the authenticated user.

`SOURCE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` controls which public HTTPS hosts the server may read. Source URLs outside that allowlist remain available for manual opening and excerpt attachment.

Optional recorded examples are local files under `data/recorded/`. They are excluded from Git; without them the application opens a fictional starter case without recorded results. Fresh cases and live tools do not require recordings.

## Checks

- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm build`

Internal planning documents, research archives, local database files, exports and credentials are intentionally excluded from this repository. Do not force-add them.
